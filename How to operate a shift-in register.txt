Part number: SN74HC165
Part name: 8-bit parallel-load shift register

Pins:
#1: SH/LD(bar) [stands for SHift (on HIGH)/LoaD (on LOW)]. When given a LOW, the chip loads data from 8 input pins (A~H: pin #11~14 and pin #3~6); when given a HIGH, the chip is prepared to shift data to the serial output QH (pin #9). By prepared, I mean it still needs to wait for a trigger, which is given by a falling edge of CLK-INH (pin #15).

#2: CLK [stands for CLocK]. After the shift is triggered, a rising edge in CLK shifts the next internal register to the serial output QH (pin #9).

#3~6: Input pins E~H. Inputs are sent into internal registers.

#7: QH(bar): negated serial output.

#8: GND: ground.

#9: QH: serial output.

#10: SER [stands for SERial]: serial input. The data that comes into this pin will be shift before all other pins (no need for a CLK rising edge).

#11~14: Input pins A~D. Inputs are sent into internal registers.

#15: CLK-INH [stands for CLocK-INHibit (on HIGH)]. When given a HIGH, the chip does not shift, in other words, CLK pin does not work; when given a LOW, the chip shifts. So a falling edge in CLK-INH triggers the shift.

#16: Vcc: power supply.
